# What is dTip?

dTip (Decentralized Tip) is an open-source, blockchain-powered platform that allows creators, activists, and non-profits to raise funds without relying on traditional, centralized donation services. Built on the Soneium blockchain (an Optimistic _rollup_ based on the OP Stack â€” Ethereum _Layer 2_), dTip ensures zero fees for donations, eliminating trust assumptions, high fees, and censorship. It is borderless, permissionless, and fully transparent, offering a decentralized solution to global fundraising.
