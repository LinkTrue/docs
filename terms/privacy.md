      2. Your IP address
      3. The data you entered in the _dTip_ application
      4. The section of _dTip_ where the error happened
   3. Once the issue is resolved, these details are **erased** by _**dTip**_.
   4. We do **not** control how _Sentry_ handles this data, but rest assured, _dTip_'s only goal is to fix errors and improve your experience. Many websites use similar tools for this purpose.
3. **Your Data is Public by Design**
   1. _dTip_ stores profile data on a **public blockchain**, meaning anyone can see it.
