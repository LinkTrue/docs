_**dTip**_**&#x20;Respects Your Privacy**

At dTip, we take your privacy seriously. Here’s what you need to know:

1. **No Personal Data Collection**
   * _dTip_ **never** collects or stores personal data. We don’t track you, and we don’t sell or share any user information.
2. **Error Reporting with Sentry**
   * To fix issues quickly, we use [**Sentry**](http://sentry.io/), a common error-tracking tool.
   * When an error occurs, Sentry may temporarily store **technical details** like:
     * Your operating system
     * Your IP address
     * The data you entered in the _dTip_ application
     * The section of _dTip_ where the error happened
   * Once the issue is resolved, these details are **erased** by _**dTip**_.
   * We do **not** control how _Sentry_ handles this data, but rest assured, our only goal is to fix errors and improve your experience. Many websites use similar tools for this purpose.
3. **Your Data is Public by Design**
   * _dTip_ stores profile data on a **public blockchain**, meaning anyone can see it.
   * This isn’t a bug; it’s a **feature**. The whole point of _dTip_ is to share your public profile with integrity, ensuring your audience can trust the donation addresses and other information you provide.

By using _dTip_, you are choosing transparency while keeping full control over your data.
